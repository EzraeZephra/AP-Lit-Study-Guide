            Central Theme(s) - Reveals the conflict arising between man’s
            fortitude and nature’s overwhelming power
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <p>The man enters the Yukon trail, looking for his companions.</p>

            <p>
              “He was a new-comer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his
              first winter.” (London 1)
              <em>(Foreshadows his death by emphasizing his inexperience)</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              Although he was told (by a elder man) traveling alone in such cold
              weather is dangerous, the man did not care and continued traveling
            </p>

            <p>
              Man is unnamed and travels with his sole companion, a dog
              <em
                >(This technically shows the man's arrogance, as it relates back
                to him ignoring the old man's advice)</em
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              As he travels on ice, he forces his dog to explore the area first
              to check if everything is safe
            </p>

            <p>
              By noon, he sat down and decide to build a fire. However, he was
              shocked by how numb his hand and feet had become
            </p>

            <p>
              The dog's instinct tells it to stop traveling and build a camp by
              the fire, but the man did not care
            </p>

            <p>
              The man soon falls through ice into the water, freezing his lower
              body
            </p>

            <p>
              The man knew he was in deep trouble and needed to build a fire
              immediately but failed after many attempts
            </p>

            <p>
              After gathering bark and lighting a fire, snow from a tree above
              falls on it and snuffs the fire out
            </p>

            <p>
              He then decides to kill the dog and warm his body with it's blood.
              (Fails due to his physical state)
            </p>

            <p>
              After a last-ditch attempt at charging down the trail, the man
              dies without even making it 100ft down the trail

            <p>
              After spending some time with Hunter, she becomes attracted to

            <p>Part 1:</p>
            <p>
              Story is set on the <em>Nellie</em>, which is anchored at the
              mouth of the River Thames
            </p>
            <p>
              Five men on the ship: the director / captain, the lawyer, the
              accountant, Marlow, and the narrator
            </p>
            <p>
              Marlows travels to what is presumably Brussels (described as a
              whited sepulchre (like a tomb)) to sign his employment contract
            </p>
            <p>
              Marlow tells a story (one much after his journey to the Congo) on
              how Fresleven, his predecessor, was killed over some hens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The doctor takes measurements of Marlow's skull, in hopes of
              learning something that may give Belgians an advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aunt bids Marlow farewell (Conrad was never able to IRL), and is
              ignorant that the company's true goal is not in civilization, but
              profit
            </p>
            <p>
              After getting on the French steamer to Africa, Marlow encounters a
              ship "firing into the continent".
            </p>
            <p>
              Arrives at the Company's outer station, which is super run-down
            </p>
            <p>
              Marlow remarks that he had known “The flabby, pretending,
              weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly” for his first
              impression of the outer station.
              <em
                >(means that Marlow suggests the fundamental evil of imperialism
                is greed, not violence)</em

            <p>
              Notices a group of dying native laborers, and offers a biscuit to
              one of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marlow is told about Kurtz and his great feats, and entrusts
              Marlow to update Kurtz on the situation at the outer station.
            </p>
            <p>Then travels in a caravan for 15 days to the central station</p>
            <p>One of his white companions falls ill and must be carried</p>
            <p>
              The steamer Marlow was supposed to command was sunk, who suspects
              that this is intentional
            </p>

              Fog rolls in and cry from the natives are heard; classified by

              Cannibals hungry and are out of food (their rotten hippo meat was
              thrown out by the pilgrims); Marlow notes their incredible
              resistant in holding back their hunger; leader of the cannibal
              wants to eat the natives that cried out to them

            <p>
              After arriving at Kurtz's place, Marlow talks with the Russian
              about Kurtz <em>(The Russian is infatuated with Kurtz</em>
            </p>
            <p>Kurtz is very ill and is dying during this period.</p>
            <p>Marlow discovers that there are heads on the fencepost</p>

              The manager goes to speak with Kurtz, and then Marlow sees Kurtz’s
              mistress who is described as having a strong hold on Kurtz.
            </p>
            <p>
              He manager comes out and talks to Marlow, explaining that Kurtz is
              unsound and closed off to the company for the time being
              <em>(Marlow defends him and falls out of favor)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Russian trader finds out that Kurtz ordered the attack on the
              steamer so that the manager would think he is dead and turn back
              <em>(Ends up being threatened, and leaves)</em>
            </p>

              and notices that he is not there
            </p>
            <p>
              He decides to look for Kurtz and finds him crawling away on a dirt
              trail
            </p>
            <p>
              He sees that there are native rituals and informs Kurtz that he
              will be lost if he continues on with it
              <em>(Kurtz returns to the boat)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a crowd that watches him leave and they are filled with
              joy <em>(Pilgrims open fire on this crowd)</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              Manager ignores Marlow on the ride back to civilization because he
              too is unsound.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kurtz entrusts Marlow with his legacy, and gives him all his
              documents
            </p>
            <p>
              Kurtz dies saying "the horror!! the horror!!"
              <em
                >(Could be seen as Kurtz reflecting on his time in the

              After barely surviving his illnesses, Marlow returns to sepulchral
              city, Brussels
            </p>
            <p>
              Representative of the company comes and tries to retrieve the
              Kurtz's papers, but Marlow only gives them a cut version of his
              pamphlet on savage customs
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>

              for publication, stating that Kurtz's real skills were in
              extremist politics
            </p>
            <p>
              He visits Kurtz's fiancé and lies to her that his last words were
