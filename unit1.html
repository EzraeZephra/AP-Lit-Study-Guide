              Sylvia is a shy 9-year-old who is known to be in-tune with nature
              <em>(She has no friends)</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              Hunter offers Sylvia $10 (lot of money at the time) if she tells
              him where the heron is
            </p>

            <p>
              After spending some time with Hunter, she becomes attracted to
              him, though repelled by his bird hunting.
            </p>

            <p>Sylvia climbs up the tallest tree to find the heron</p>

            <p>
              She finds the Heron, but is enlightened with a "mystical union
              with nature"
            </p>

            <p>
              Sylvia does not divulge the secret of the heron in the end as she
              is not ready to surrender her relationship with nature for human
              interests

              Innocence and Nature vs Corruption of Man: Instead of giving into
              the temptation of money and greed presented by the hunter, Sylvia
              maintains her innocence and her respect toward nature by
              preserving the secret of the white heron.
