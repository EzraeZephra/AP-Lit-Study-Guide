# Doc Survival Guide
Founded on October 19, 2022, a day before Dr. Michael William's first exam for his high school AP Literature class, the DSG or "Doc Survival Guide," is a student-based project that hopes to create a group study guide maintained by a community of AP Lit student volunteers. Our goal is to make history as the first ever class to have more than half of its students end the year with an A in Doc's AP Lit class, and to set an example of what can be done when the Damien brotherhood comes together in pursuit of a common goal.
